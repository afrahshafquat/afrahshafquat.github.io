**Postdoctoral Associate, [Weill Cornell Medicine](www.weillcornell.org)**


**Research** My research interests are in development of statistical and computational methods to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional datasets. 


**Bio** I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Weill Cornell Medicine researching cell dynamics using single cell RNA sequencing data. 

I have a PhD in Computational Biology (2020) from [Cornell University](www.cornell.edu) where my dissertation focused on [inferring errors in disease diagnoses using Bayesian hierarchical models](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3387-z). Prior to Cornell, I graduated from [MIT](www.mit.edu) with an S.B. in Biological Engineering (2013) and led projects as a Bioninformatics Analyst at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/).
